[11.25.15]
made first variation of code to move 2 motors at the same time using 'string' and 'indexOf'.
need to figure out letter's position and change the code to make 4 letter input for motors which will allow to make them change position one by one.
[12.2.15]
Figureded out programming part completly, need to finish writing it down. Still need to figure out how to attach plastic to motors and how to fix motors themselves.
[12.6.15]
Finished the code. Still trying to figure out how to attach plastic to motors.
[12.8.15]
Used clear tape to attach plastic to motors. Callibrated angles and checked all letters.
[12.9.15]
Did presentation. Tried to set up all 4 letters for the first time. Apparently, each motor callibrated diffrently in sense of where the 0 degree is.
